# SDG 1 – No Poverty Action Hub
This project is a front-end website developed to support **Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1: No Poverty)**. The website aims to raise awareness of poverty-related issues and present practical actions that individuals can take to contribute toward poverty reduction. The project was created as part of a coursework assignment using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**.

## Project Objectives
- To present SDG 1 (No Poverty) in a clear and accessible web format
- To raise awareness of poverty as a multi-dimensional issue
- To demonstrate front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
- To implement interactive features such as image carousels and animations

## Website Structure
The website consists of **three main pages**:
1. **Home (index.html)**
   Introduces SDG 1 and explains the purpose of the website. Includes a hero section, key information about poverty, and an overview of why poverty reduction matters.

2. **Gallery (gallery.html)**
   Displays images related to poverty reduction efforts using a JavaScript-based image carousel and an image grid with lightbox preview.

3. **Take Action (actions.html)**
   Provides practical steps, checklists, and FAQs to guide users on how they can contribute to poverty reduction efforts.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure and semantic content
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Image carousel logic
- **jQuery** – Animations and user interaction effects

## Key Features
- Responsive navigation bar with hamburger menu for mobile devices
- Hero section with call-to-action buttons
- JavaScript image carousel with next/previous controls and auto-slide
- jQuery scroll reveal animations
- FAQ section with slide toggle interaction
- Lightbox image preview
- Back-to-top button for improved navigation

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Ensure all files follow the structure shown above.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser (recommended: Chrome).
4. For best results, use a local server (e.g. VS Code Live Server).

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes
During development, challenges such as incorrect file paths, JavaScript loading issues, and hidden content caused by animation logic were encountered. These issues were resolved through debugging using browser developer tools and systematic code checks. The project improved understanding of front-end integration, file organization, and responsive web design.
